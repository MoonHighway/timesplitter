# Instructor TODO Checklist

Checklist components are used to add a list of items that an instructor must accomplish. They are indicators and reminders that are baked into courses. For example, there is typically a classroom setup checklist that the instructor must complete upon arrival. Additionally they can be used anywhere to verify or keep track of things.

<Info>
Lists save state in sessionStorage. They can be checked off once per class.
