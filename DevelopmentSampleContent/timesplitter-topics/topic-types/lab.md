# Labs are student challenges

At this point the students have seen a task demonstrated, and they have performed the task themselves with the assistance of the instructor during the exercise. Now it's time to see if they learned anything, can they do it on their own?

## Present Labs as Requirements and Wireframes

Labs should be presented to developers as real world tasks. Don't tell them how to do it, but show them what needs to be done in the same way that a project manager or product owner would explain what needs to be built. 

## Progress lab difficulty

Programming is hard. Some students may only complete the first step in each lab. Create labs that are easy enough to be successful with the first step, and more challenging with later steps. Having more optional challenges for students who make it farther through labs will keep everyone busy for the entire topic time.
