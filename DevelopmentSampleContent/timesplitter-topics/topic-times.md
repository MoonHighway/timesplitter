# Time is key to Timesplitter

All topics can be associated with time. However, once time is set on a topic any child topics will estimate time, and any parent topics will obtain their time from the child. 

## Section time

Section and parent topic time is obtained by the child topics. If a section has three topic and they each take 5 minutes, then the section will report 15 minutes. You cannot set time on a section or parent where time is set in their child topics.

## Step Estimates

Once you set the time on a topic, time will not be settable on the children. This means if you have a parent topic where the time has been set for 10 minutes, and it has 5 child topics, the timesplitter will estimate roughly ~2 minutes for each child topic.
