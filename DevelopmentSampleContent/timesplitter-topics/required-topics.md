## Required Topics

These topics are very essential, they must be covered. Topics that come later in the course will depend on required topics found earlier in the course.

## Bonus Topics

Bonus Topics are topics that are not required, if you get to them you get to them. The course is not dependent on this topic.

## Locking topic time

Timesplitter will adjust time for each topic depending upon the remaining time in a course. If a topic absolutely needs a certain amount of time to be taught, it can be locked. This means that the timesplitter will not automatically adjust this time for this topic.
