# Slides

Slides are slide show presentations. Typically these happen at the beginning of the course, or the beginning of each section, but they can be added anywhere inside of an agenda.

## Keep it Short

We built Timesplitter as a tool for managing hands on interactive classes. We believe that slide shows and lecture presentations should be kept to an absolute minimum. However, we also acknowledge that they can add value to courses especially when concepts need to be introduced or explained with visual learning elements.
