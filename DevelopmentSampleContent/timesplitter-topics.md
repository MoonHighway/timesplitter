# Welcome to Timesplitter

Timesplitter is a tool that classroom instructors can use to manage their daily agenda and stay on track.

## Treat your courses like software

Timesplitter is designed to treat your course materials as if they were software. The raw content files for courses are saved as markdown. `timesplitter.json` is a manifest for the course that explains when each topic should be covered and how long it will take. Timesplitter courses are saved in github repos, which means they can easily be branched, forked, and updated... just like software!
