# Samples are for code

Timesplitter allows you to save all of your coding steps in notes. This makes it ideal as a tool to use for live coded classes. Samples do not have to be live coded, code can easily be copied and pasted anywhere the instructor needs it.

## Students shouldn't follow along

Samples live in-between [exercises](/agenda/timesplitter-topics/topic-types/exercise)  and [slides](/agenda/timesplitter-topics/topic-types/slide-topic). Students watch as an instructor demonstrates a coding task or pattern, but not actually code the sample themselves. This gives an instructor the ability to introduce and demonstrate things first. Exercises will give the students a chance to follow along.
