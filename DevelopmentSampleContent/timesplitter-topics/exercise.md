# Everyone builds Exercises

Exercises are step through examples of coding tasks that mimic what a developer will do in the real-world. This is typically the first time a student gets some hands on practice. The instructor writes some code, tests the code, and the students follow. 

## Everyone completes each step

Exercises are made up of steps. Before the instructor moves on to the next step, they should verify that the students have completed the first step. Help any student that needs help successfully completing the step to move on. Have students help their neighbors too. Don't leave anyone behind.

## Progress the difficulty

Always start exercises with steps that `beginners` can complete. The goal of a class is to build confidence. Everyone should always be able to complete the first step or two in an exercise. Each step can get progressively more difficult if needed. Save advanced and expert steps for the end, and allow them to be optional. Overwhelming beginner students with expert patterns makes subjects seem more difficult than them may be and can be detrimental to the learning process. Build confidence, then make it hard.

## Always include extra iterations

Timesplitter will manage your time, but what if you finish early, or you students do not complete steps on time? Each class will be different in the number of steps that they will make it in a given time frame. Some classes will complete 7 steps, some classes will complete 2. Exercises should be designed in a way that provides value for completing the first two steps. Every additional step can be optional. Faster classes will make it a little farther, but the class should move on to the next topic within the same time frame as ever other class. This is how everything is always covered, and entire sections are not left out.
